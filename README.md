  GM Forge - Virtual Tabletop Crack Serial Key 
If you are looking for a way to play tabletop RPGs online with your friends, you might have heard of GM Forge - Virtual Tabletop, a standalone application that lets you create and host your own games. GM Forge is a sandbox for GMs, and has 6 sample systems available on the workshop with some automation setup for basic play, with the option of downloading additional user created content and mods through the steam workshop.

When you buy a copy of GM Forge, your friends join you through their web browser without purchasing a copy. Sounds great, right?
